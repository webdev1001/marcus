## Primary Navigation Extras

As of Genesis 2.1, the Primary Navigation Extras options have been removed for new installs. (upgrades of current installs to 2.1 will not lose the Primary Navigation Extras settings) The prefered method of adding custom links like Twitter or RSS is to use a custom menu item and give it a CSS class of right.

3. Email
4. Facebook
5. Flickr
6. Foursquare
7. GitHub
8. Google+

11. Pinterest
12. Reddit
13. RSS
14. StumbleUpon
15. Tumblr
16. Twitter
17. Vimeo
18. WordPress
19. YouTube

For example, to add a Twitter link, add a custom link to your menu and in the CSS Classes input field enter right twitter. Refer to the theme docs for details.

## Content Boxes:

The custom content boxes make use of DIV classes. For example ...

	<div class="content-box-blue">some random text</div>

There are 8 styles to choose from. Refer to the style sheet for details.

## Gradient Buttons:

Each button has a unique class. For example ...
